This is my first project that is *somewhat* responsive. I have tried to make it look as appealing as possible but I'm still not good at making things look pretty. I plan to revisit all of these early projects later on.

Note: I'm having issues with the CDN from FCC in this challenge. Some user stories wouldn't appear as completed even if they had been. I managed to have them all pass for now.
