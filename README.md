# Product Landing Page

This is the third project included in the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

You can see the webpage live by going to the following link:
https://roman-octavian.github.io/FCC-Product-Landing/

This one took a bit longer than the first two since it is the first webpage that's responsive. The form is submitted to a static address as this is an almost exclusively front-end project. I apologize if the script (three green lines menu) at the top left of the webpage is awkwardly placed but I don't want to mess with it because it's required as is by FCC for this project.

Note: I'm having issues with the CDN from FCC in this challenge. Some user stories won't pass even if they have been completed. I'll try to find a fix.

Thank you for checking out my profile.
